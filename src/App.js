        <h2 className="objec">Objection Addressing</h2>
        <p>From its inception in the 1st century AD, Christianity has faced objections and persecution. Initially, it was viewed with suspicion and hostility by both the Roman authorities and the Jewish religious leaders. Early Christians were often accused of atheism (due to their refusal to worship Roman gods), treason (for not offering sacrifices to the emperor), and practicing bizarre rituals (such as misunderstandings about the Eucharist).

            During the Middle Ages, conflicts arose with Islam, leading to periods of both co-existence and violent confrontations, such as the Crusades. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century also saw objections from within Christianity itself, leading to significant religious wars and divisions.

            <p> Present Events
            In contemporary times, objections to Christianity come from a variety of sources. In some countries, Christians face persecution and legal restrictions. In secular and pluralistic societies, objections often stem from disagreements over social and moral issues, such as LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive rights, and the role of religion in  life. There are also intellectual critiques from atheists, agnostics, and followers of other religions.

        <h2 className="underdeno">Understanding  Denominations</h2>
         <p><strong>Catholicism: </strong>
            Rooted in the early church, Catholicism emphasizes tradition and the authority of the Pope. It upholds the sacraments and teachings of the Church as central to faith and practice.

            <br/> <strong>Protestantism:</strong> 
            Emerging from the Reformation in the 16th century, Protestant denominations share a focus on the authority of Scripture and justification by faith. Each branch, like Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Anglican, has unique theological emphases and governance structures.
            
            <br/> <strong>Orthodox Christianity:</strong> 
            Comprising Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, it emphasizes the continuity of apostolic tradition, liturgical worship, and the significance of the Ecumenical Councils in defining doctrine.
            
           <br/> <strong>Non-Denominational and Ecumenical Christians</strong>
            
            <br/><strong>Non-Denominational: </strong>
            These Christians emphasize a personal relationship with Jesus and often avoid strict denominational affiliations, focusing instead on the Bible and contemporary worship.
            
            <br/> <strong>Ecumenical: </strong>
            This movement seeks unity among different Christian denominations, promoting dialogue and cooperation in shared beliefs and practices.
